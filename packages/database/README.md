# @flow/database

A progressive database architecture for Flow music player, designed to evolve from local-only to full cloud sync capabilities.

## üéØ Architecture Overview

### Phase 1: Local-Only (Current)
- **Storage**: MMKV for simple, fast local storage
- **Scope**: Playlists, settings, playback history
- **Data**: Local music files only
- **Complexity**: Minimal, fast development

### Phase 2: Local Database (Future)
- **Storage**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Scope**: Full local music library management
- **Data**: Artists, albums, tracks with relationships
- **Complexity**: Medium, structured data

### Phase 3: Cloud Sync (Future)
- **Storage**: SQLite + Cloud APIs
- **Scope**: Cross-device sync, remote music
- **Data**: Local + remote music, user preferences
- **Complexity**: High, distributed system
